# Storytellers üìñ Handbook

## Overview

Upstream Marketing depends on great storytelling to get the message out about our amazing community.

It's no secret that governance and technical documentation can be kind of on the boring side. And that's ok‚Äìit's not always there for entertainment purposes. It is about providing valuable information and get you were you need to go. But that said, an important message can be lost without an entertaining messenger. 

In this role, Storytellers are here to help Kubernetes contributors hear the latest news in the most entertianing ways. Storytellers will take us on journeys through words and visuals to help us craft.

## Workflow ‚ö°Ô∏è

Storytelling is welcome in any medium that can be supported by the Upstream Marketing team. This includes but is not limited to written word‚Äìas outlined in [blogging guidelines]‚Äìor through video following our [YouTube guidelines]. 

Storytellers are constantly building new ways to share, and these resources are gathered in the [storytelling resources folder]. 

## Minimum Skills and Requirements

- Have a passion for telling stories, technical writing, journalism, and painting pictures with words
- Desire to be a Kubernetes Org Member and if not already, work your way towards membership
- Helpful but not required: Comfortable with working with GitHub workflows or working in a collaborative document like Hackmd.io

## Expectations

Anyone is welcome to contribute when they have time. The core expectation of storytelling is taking responsibility for getting the story from inception to published.

If you would like to be listed as a member of the team, here are the expectations:

1. Be prepared to write one blog a quarter and participate in edits to other articles. The time commitment is typically 5-10 hours per quarter depending on the number of blog posts in the review queue.
2. Storytellers are expected to attend at least one upstream marketing team meeting a month or check-in to remain active.
3. Remain non-partial: if you receive a request to write about a project, an individual, or a group of people from your employer, you should ask an impartial blogger to write it.
4. As with all contribution to Kubernetes, adhere to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.md), values, and principles of the project.

There is no shadow roles for Storytellers. If Storytellers are interested in becoming a shadow they can read more about it in the [Marketing Council Handbook].
