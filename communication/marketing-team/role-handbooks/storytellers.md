## Expectations

Anyone is welcome to contribute when they have time. The core expectation of storytelling is taking responsibility for getting the story from inception to published.

If you would like to be listed as a member of the team, here are the expectations:

1. Be prepared to write one blog a quarter and participate in edits to other articles. The time commitment is typically 5-10 hours per quarter depending on the number of blog posts in the review queue.
2. Storytellers are expected to attend at least one upstream marketing team meeting a month or check-in to remain active.
3. Remain non-partial: if you receive a request to write about a project, an individual, or a group of people from your employer, you should ask an impartial blogger to write it.
4. As with all contribution to Kubernetes, adhere to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.md), values, and principles of the project.

There is no shadow roles for Storytellers. If Storytellers are interested in
becoming the teams sig-docs-liaison they should follow the process for the
