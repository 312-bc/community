# Upstream Marketing Blog Guidelines

This initiative falls under the [Upstream Marketing Charter](./CHARTER.md).

We are looking for Kubernetes-curious community members who are **interested in writing** and **care about getting the word out** to our huge community of users, developers, and contributors of all types. Here's how to get involved.

## Requested Content

We are looking for:

* TODO << Request specific types of content

Other types of content, like Kubernetes capabilities and tutorials, are better suited for the [SIG-Docs blogging initiative](/sig-docs/blog-subproject/README.md).

## Submit a Post

The quickest way to get involved is to let the team in [#sig-contribex-comms](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03KT3SUJ20) know that you have an idea for an article.

To reduce the amount of editing done directly in GitHub, a two-stage approach is highly recommended:

1. Create your proposal draft in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) or
   HackMD (https://hackmd.io), and ask for a review in
   [#sig-contribex-comms](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03KT3SUJ20).
   This will allow easier editing, especially if major changes or restructuring
   is needed.
2. Once you have reflected any feedback in the proposal draft, submit the
   revised article as a Pull Request. Additional changes can still be made
   during the PR review process, but they should be more about details than
   major modifications.

For now, our official process is to use [SIG Docs' system](/sig-docs/blog-subproject/README.md), with one change: instead of directly creating the file in the Kubernetes site repository, as instructed abovem it's initially created in the [contributor-site](https://github.com/kubernetes/contributor-site), in the appropriate folder (i.e. the right year in `contributor-site/content/en/blog/`). This will lead to an initial review process before it gets mirrored to the main Kubernetes site.


## Blogger Expectations, Responsibilities, and Info

Anyone is welcome to contribute when they have time.

If you would like to be listed as a member of the team, here are the expectations:

1. Be prepared to write one blog a quarter and participate in edits to other articles. The time commitment is typically 5-10 hours per quarter depending on the number of blog posts in the review queue.
2. Bloggers are expected to attend at least one upstream marketing team meeting a month or check-in to remain active.
3. Remain non-partial: if you receive a request to write about a project, an individual, or a group of people from your employer, you should ask an impartial blogger to write it.
4. As with all contribution to Kubernetes, adhere to the [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct.md), values, and principles of the project.

## How to Write an Effective Blog

Keep the following points in mind as you write in order to speed up the review process:

* Use inclusive language understandable by everyone
  * Rephrase gendered pronouns (change "he" or "she" to "they" or adjust to remove)
  * Remember nothing is simple when you're starting out (remove "just," "simply", and "easy")
  * Define terminology or acronyms (do not assume people know what a term means)
  * Shy away from jargon and colloquial expressions
  * Write clearly and avoid ambiguous sentences
* Emphasize the things you want readers to remember; tell a story
  * Stay on topic and stick to the facts
  * Design a beginning, middle, and end to your story with a clear call to action
  * Provide evidence and data where applicable, to back up your message
* Make the article visually appealing
  * Include at least one image (and use public domain or Creative Commons licensed ones)
  * Prefer inclusive images like those from [WOCinTech](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wocintechchat/) and [Queer in Tech](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mapbox/albums/72157713100349311)
  * Find images on sites like [Creative Commons](https://search.creativecommons.org/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/public-domain-images/), and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/images/stock/public-domain))
* Be accountable and honest as an author
  * Remove anything that lacks adequate evidence
  * Avoid interjecting personal reactions
  * Ensure that the blog post is reviewed by the anyone being mentioned in the piece
  * As the author, never talk about your employer, sell, promote, or pitch; this is about upstream community endeavours and the individuals and groups that create it

## Review Process

This process is initiated in [#sig-contribex-comms](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03KT3SUJ20) and uses the processes from the sig-docs blog [subproject](/sig-docs/blog-subproject/README.md). Please ask for review from community liaisons on the sig-docs-blog team or let the team in [#sig-contribex-comms](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C03KT3SUJ20) know you need help.
