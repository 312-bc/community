# Contributor Comms Subproject Lead Role Handbook

## Overview

This handbook outlines expectations and responsibilities for Kubernetes Contributor Communications Subproject Leads and shadows.

Contributor Comms Subproject Leads are general, top level leads of any and all matters relating to the subproject. Individual area concerns should generally be handled by the area leads, but Subproject Leads may act as advisors or interim leads in cases where subproject leads are not available and a decision is needed.

General responsibilities which do not fall under an area lead may be assumed to be the responsibility of the Subproject Lead[s].


## **Minimum Skills and Requirements**

A subproject lead should be:



* A member of the [Kubernetes GitHub Org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org)
* Available to attend/lead regular Contributor Comms meetings and collaborate asynchronously via the #sig-contribex-comms channel in the Kubernetes Slack
* Able and willing to actively recruit members and shadows for the benefit of the entire team and the contributor
* [Preferred] Familiar with managing a social media presence by either having personal accounts or managing another account (brand, OSS project, employer, local nonprofit, etc)

### **Expected Time Investment**


Team leads: 3-5 hours per week. Shadows: 1-3 hours per week.


## **General Expectations**

## **Subproject Lead Shadowing**

* Regular meeting leadership
* Gaining familiarity with key connections, such as the SIG-ContribEx Chairs
* Becoming an owner (approver privileges) on relevant repos
* Understanding and ownership of key subproject docs such as the [README](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/contributor-comms/README.md) and [Charter](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/contributor-comms/CHARTER.md)
