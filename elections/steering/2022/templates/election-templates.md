## Election Announcement

It's Steering Committee election season again!

We're getting a bit of an early start this year but over the next 7 weeks we will be electing four (3) seats on the Steering Committee. Each of these seats will serve for a two (2) year term. Christoph Blecker, Stephen Augustus, Paris Pittman, and Tim Pepper are halfway through their terms and will continue to serve on the Steering Committee[1].

The first phase of the election has two parts:

1. Candidate nominations
2. Voter exceptions

## Nominations

If you would like to nominate yourself or someone else for one of the three available seats, follow the process in the election guide[2]. This involves writing a candidate issue, posting to kubernetes-dev, and writing a bio and information about your candidacy.

## Exceptions

The full list of current voters by GitHub username is posted in the election repository: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/elections/steering/2022/voters.yaml [4]

The requirements for voting are to have had at least 50 project contributions in the last year and being a current member of a Kubernetes GitHub organization. We do our best to source contribution data from many areas however we know that many types of contributions to the project are difficult to measure and we apologize for any not counted. If we've missed you for any reason, please file an exception request[3] and we'll take a look as soon as possible.

## New Voting System

This is the second year we will be using Elekto[5] for the Kubernetes Steering elections. Elekto was commissioned as an internship project for us by the CNCF. You'll find it has a much more modern UI, and does not rely on email at all to enable voting. It uses GitHub authentication so all we need to know is your GitHub username. If you log in to Elekto at https://elections.k8s.io/app/elections/2022, you can also directly check your eligibility if you don't want to search through the YAML file linked above.

## Schedule

The following are the critical dates for this election:

* Tuesday, August 30 - Candidate nominations due at the end of the day in AoE time
* Friday, September 2 - All candidate bios due at the end of the day in AoE time
* Tuesday, September 6 - Election Begins via email ballots
* Friday, September 16 - Deadline to submit voter exception requests
* Thursday, September 29 - Election Closes at the end of the day in AoE time
* Monday, October 3 - Public announcement of Results at Public Steering Committee Meeting


We will be posting regular updates to dev@kubernetes during the election as well as updates in the community meeting and on Slack.
